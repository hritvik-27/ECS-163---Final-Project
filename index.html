    <h1>Challenging The Big 4</h1>
    <h2>A Roadmap for Growing India's Middle Cities</h2>
    <p>India has 4 major cities namely, Mumbai (Greater Mumbai), Bengaluru, Delhi, Ahmedabad.<br>
        These cities are far more economically powerful than any other cities in India. 
        The circles on the map below are proportional in size to how much is spent on credit cards in each city<br>
        In order to aid national development, 
        the smaller/mid-tier cities need to grow and develop. This would lead to overall GDP growth, reduction in regional inequality, and 
        greater spending power <br>
        But how exactly do we know which areas to focus on to develop? <br>
        We have analyzed credit card spending across the 2013-15 period, with the goal of leveraging
        consumer spending habits to enact policy changes for the growth of these smaller cities <br>
        Our visualizations provide in-depth details about the spending in each city, from which we have generated 
        a series of suggestions for policymakers, economists, banks and businesses <br>
        We have also developed an interactive version, to aid in drawing comparisons between any of the cities,
         to assist in drawing your own conclusions about the best approach for development. 
    </p>
    <h3>What's So Different?</h3>
    <p>The difference in total spending is staggering, but is far from the only difference between the cities.<br>
        Consumer spending habits differ considerably, with our particular focus on the types of goods being bought, 
        the people buying them, and the types of credit cards they own.<br>
        This suggests how to target interventions on a per-city basis, from the industries to support, to 
        the new products banks should market.<br>
        Our comparison chart looks at the total spend in each city, as well as the proportion of its money it spends on 
        entertainment and groceries, the proportion spent by women, and using the lowest tier (silver) credit cards.<br>
        From this example comparison, it is clear that there are opportunities to exploit the unique habits of small cities.</p>
    <h3>Bengaluru vs. Hyderabad</h3>
    <p>Bengaluru and Hyderabad are important cities in the Southern part of India. 
        However, there is a stark difference between the spending in these two cities.<br>
        Bengaluru is the 2nd largest city by total spending while Hyderabad is the 3rd smallest. 
        These differences can be seen in detail in this radar plot. <br>
        Here we see that the total spending in the cities varies by a considerable amount. 
        Grocery Spending (as seen by the radial plot below), contributes to the larger part of Hyderabadâ€™s economy. <br>
        In order to get Hyderabad up to the level of Bengaluru, policymakers, along with the assistance of banks and businesses,
         can offer subsidies or incentives to encourage spending in the already well-established grocery sector.
         This will cause the overall economy of Hyderabad to grow faster. <br>
        Entertainment spending in Hyderabad is lower than that in Bengaluru. 
        One possible reason for this is that the population has less disposable income. <br>
        The increased income from cheaper groceries, as well as overall growth in the economy of Hyderabad 
        will aid spending in areas such as entertainment as well.</p>
    <h3>Credit Card Accessibility</h3>
    <p>A surprising trend emerges when looking at the types of credit card used by consumers.<br>
        It might be expected that the wealthiest cities would use the top-tier cards, reserved for financially secure customers.<br>
        But look at the difference in silver card spending: The Big 4 use the most basic card far more often.<br>
        Clearly the wealthy would choose better cards, so what's going on here? <br>
        If our entry tier cards are being used more often, this implies that more people own them. 
        In other words, credit card ownership of any kind is a driving force in growing a city's economy.<br>
        By introducing new, even more basic, tiers of card, and offering rewards for joining, banks should be able
        to drive growth</p>
    <h3>Towards Gender Equality</h3>
    <p>Female spending power is highly correlated with the level of development in a certain region. <br>
        This can be seen in the difference in the percentages of female spenders in big cities (e.g. Delhi) 
        and smaller cities (e.g. Chennai). <br>
        While the female-to-male ratio is higher in big cities, this ratio is more favorable to men or is 1:1 in smaller cities.<br>
        By targeting programs to increase financial freedom for women, and promote gender equality, we can change the female-to-male 
        ratio in smaller cities, promoting growth.</p>
    <h3>Explore the Data</h3>
    <p>Our ideas for generating growth are just the starting point.<br>
        Below is a fully interactive version of the charts we have shown.<br>
        Use these to compare more cities, and generate more policy intervention ideas.</p>
