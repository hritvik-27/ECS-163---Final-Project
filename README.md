# Consumer Spending in India
## ECS 163 Final Project
### Group 16

Our visualization is formed of two main charts:\
On the left of the page is a map of India.\
On the right is a radar plot for comparing cities.

The map shows the total spending per city in the given time range by a circle above the geographical position of the city, whose radius is proportional to its spend.\
The precise value (in rupees) can be seen via a tooltip when hovering above the city.\
Clicking on a circle for a city zooms in on it, and replaces the circle with a coxcomb-style glyph of the proportional spend in different categories.\
Radio buttons will appear on the right to select the category to be displayed.\
A back button will appear in the top left to return back to the original view.

The radar plot compares the cities across several dimensions.\
Initially no cities are displayed. To render a city's data on the chart, click the corresponding square below the plot.\
Clicking again will remove a city from the plot.
